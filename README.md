# Unexpected Route Matching in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes and complex route configurations in React Router v6.  The problem involves routes unexpectedly matching (or failing to match) when they shouldn't.

## Problem Description

The original `App.js` file contains a seemingly straightforward route setup.  However, under certain conditions (e.g., specific URL structures or component interactions), routes may not match correctly, leading to unexpected rendering behavior or navigation problems. 

The solution provided in `AppSolution.js` addresses these issues.  Please refer to the solution's comments for specific explanations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the behavior by navigating to different routes in your browser.  Note how the original version behaves incorrectly, while the solution resolves these issues.

## Solution

The solution might involve several approaches, including:

* **Careful route ordering:** Ensuring routes are ordered from most specific to least specific.
* **Correct use of `useParams` and other hooks:** Proper handling of route parameters and dynamic segments.
* **Employing `Outlet` for nested routes:** If nesting is needed, this correctly renders child routes.
* **Using a wildcard route ('*') effectively:**  For catching any unmatched paths.
* **Checking for typos and inconsistencies:** Simple errors in path definitions can lead to these problems. 

This example helps illustrate the importance of detailed route configuration in React Router v6 to avoid unexpected behavior.
